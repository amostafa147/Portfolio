# PortfolioV2
I initially created this website in 2020 as part of an assignment for my UCSD Extension Front-End Web Development certification. In this website, I wrote a bit about myself, listed many of my projects (on this page), uploaded my photos to a photography page, and more. I regularly update this website with my projects.
